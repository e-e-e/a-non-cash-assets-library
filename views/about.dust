<h2>About</h2>
<p>NONCASH.SPACE is a library that lists our assets and facilitates contact that hopefully leads to sharing skills, tools and spaces. This library was developed through conversations with you, our community, about what stands in the way between your creative ideas and realising them (aside from the need for cold, hard cash). We researched how we currently find or share the skills, spaces and tools that we have and built this space that facilitates sharing particularly for the underrepresented and under-resourced artists among us.</p>
<p>The initial prototype was funded by the <a href="http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/" title="Visit the City of Sydney website.">City of Sydney</a> through a <a href="http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/community/grants-and-sponsorships/community-grants/knowledge-exchange-sponsorships" title="Learn about the City of Sydneyâ€™s Knowledge Exchange program.">Knowledge Exchange grant</a>.</p>
