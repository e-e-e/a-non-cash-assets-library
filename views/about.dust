<h2>About</h2>
<p>“Arts Assets Platform” is the working title for a non-cash assets digital library and facilitator. We’re currently developing this through conversations with you, our community, about what stands in the way between your creative ideas and realising them (aside from the need for cold, hard cash). We’re researching how we currently find or share the skills, spaces and tools that we have and trying to build a space (digital and physical) that facilitates sharing particularly for the underrepresented and under-resourced artists among us.</p>
<p>This project has been funded by the <a href="http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/" title="Visit the City of Sydney website.">City of Sydney</a> through a <a href="http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/community/grants-and-sponsorships/community-grants/knowledge-exchange-sponsorships" title="Learn about the City of Sydney’s Knowledge Exchange program.">Knowledge Exchange grant</a>.</p>
